# Alve revived wallpaper
## A pixelart Lively & Wallpaper Engine Wallpaper
Alve's Town animated wallpaper for [Lively](https://www.rocksdanister.com/lively/).

Best suited for Wide-Screen but it is scalable/cropable to other resolutions.

It features a realtime day-night cycle using the sunrise/-set in the weather API data. (or default properties when API is not used).

It is (I would like it to be... still working on that) responsive to weather circumstances (brightness, clouds, rain, snow... etc.).
